## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/utkarshgupta04092003/weekday.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```
   cd weekday
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser or you can check at  [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

## Usage
- You can filter the job using Location type, minimum experience, minimum base salary, job role, location, company name and tech stack. (currently company name and tech stack filter is not working as these data is not provided in the reponse)
- Once the application is running, you can scroll down the page to load more data dynamically. The application will fetch additional data from the API as you scroll, demonstrating infinite scrolling behavior.
